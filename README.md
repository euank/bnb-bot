# BnB-bot

This repository contains the fiddlings I created by reverse engineering the wire-protocol of the "node webkit" (desktop) version of the [Build 'n Bump game](https://roppychop.itch.io/build-n-bump).

## Status

The current state of the code is some poorly factored poorly managed socket.js
code to hover over the opponent and win.

I intend to refactor it out to a library and make it actually play somewhat realistically eventually.
